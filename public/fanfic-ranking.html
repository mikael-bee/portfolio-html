<h3>When He Comes Home</h3>
<p>by <u>legumii</u></p>
<p>Ten years ago, Mana Campbell's only son was killed by the Black Order. Now, Allen is plagued with strange dreams and odd feelings—why do the Noah look familiar to him? Why can he control the Ark?

<h3>Upheaval</h3>
<p>by <u>Gummichi</u></p>
<p>Only when Ghost was blessedly shielded by shadows did he dare turn around, knife in hand, to greet the beast.<br/>
    His breath caught unwillingly in his throat.<br/>
    Large. <br/>
    Ghost had always known that the Na’vi were big. It was perhaps the greatest point of intrigue for their species to those who knew little more than side-by-side comparisons. The Na’vi were massive in theory…but it was an entirely different topic to tackle when one was staring directly at where Ghost lay in hiding. <br/>
      . . . <br/>
    Ghost came to Pandora to die amongst unseen stars. He didn't care for his Avatar body - the body Tommy was meant to pilot before he died - he just wanted rest.
    Unfortunately, after his transport crashes on the surface of Pandora leaving him stranded, he's forced into wars he swore off when he left active combat. The Na'vi are brutal, but they are not unkind as they pick up the broken pieces of him and remind Ghost... <br/>
    His heart is warm so long as it is beating.

<h3>Mask of my own face + Ground Control (COD space AU)</h3>
<p>by <u>Avidcatperson</u></p>
<p>Simon “ghost” Riley is pissed. He doesn’t take kindly to being trapped in a cell and treated like a rabid animal. On top of that he takes great offence to the implication that he’s going to eat his cell mate, who is clearly sentient, with his bare hands.<br/>
    Soap is fairly sure he’s about to die. Chucked into a cell with a human? Pretty much a death sentence…hopefully Gaz can get out at least
    </p>
<h3>By Any Means Neccessary</h3>
<p>by <u>Merlinfirstlastalaways</u></p>
<p>In which Merlin wakes up and chooses violence, and decides not to rethink that choice.<br/>
    Or: Merlin realizes that, if he's going to keep Arthur safe and keep his magic a secret, he will have to get a little bit physical. Arthur has to rethink everything in existence when he's suddenly forced to confront the fact that Merlin can fight, and is in fact, bloody dangerous<br/>
    Or: The author randomly thought "Murder Twink Merlin" while re-watching the show, and decided it was his mission in life to make that a tag. <br/>

<h3>Synthetic Blues</h3>
<p>by <u>jaemyun</u></p>
<p>This was a bad idea from the beginning. Connor had been well aware of that when he'd made the decision to forge and lie his way into the DPD in the first place, after more than a month of mulling the idea over.<br/>
    One month of existing as a machine. Two months now of deviancy. A mere three months of life he endangers every time he steps into the station.<br/>
    Being thrust back into investigating deviants may feel like a cosmic joke, but he thinks it's also an opportunity.<br/>
    He'd rather act as a sleeper cell in this investigation than leave the fates of these deviants up to humans alone.<br/>
    </p>
<h3>The World Will Be Free</h3>
<p>by <u>JuneBug3178</u></p>
<p>“So, are you human or not?”<br/>
    Connor found that to be an unfair question. His worn, standard issue android jacket and damaged-but-present LED made it clear he was an android. Of course, that wasn’t really what the human in front of him was asking. The striking familiar figure with long grey hair and a Saint Bernard dog at his side was asking Connor if he was deviant.<br/>
    The answer was yes of course, but just because he was deviant didn’t mean he was human. Before Connor could make this point, the human spoke up again.<br/>
    “Of course you are, you look too goofy to be one of those mindless machines.”<br/>
    …Goofy?<br/>
    ****<br/>
    What if the prototype model RK800 wasn’t released in time to stop Markus and his deviant rebellion? What would Connor’s life as an android be like in a world he never got the chance to save?<br/>

    </p>
<h3>Twist and Shout</h3>
<p>by <u>gabriel</u> and <u>standbyme</u></p>
<p>What begins as a transforming love between Dean Winchester and Castiel Novak in the summer of 1965 quickly derails into something far more tumultuous when Dean is drafted in the Vietnam War. Though the two both voice their relationship is one where saying goodbye is never a real truth, their story becomes fraught with the tragedy of circumstance. In an era where homosexuality was especially vulnerable, Twist and Shout is the story of the love transcending time, returning over and over in its many forms, as faithful as the sea.</p>
<h3>Oathbound</h3>
<p>by <u>cywscross</u></p>
<p>Stiles leaves when it becomes clear he’ll never really be trusted again, when he can admit to himself that maybe he was never even welcomed to begin with. It’s a more freeing acceptance than he’d once thought it would be.<br/>
    Four years down the road and three years into a war that spans the globe, the supernatural has been exposed, the Beast of Gévaudan and its servants roam free, and Beacon Hills is an active warzone. In a fit of desperation, Kira attempts the same summoning ritual her mother had performed almost a century prior and what comes through is… not something any of them expects.

<h3>Another Time Travel AU ft. Stiles Who Really Doesn't (Want To) Care</h3>
<p>by <u>cywscross</u></p>
<p>This time travel business really isn't all it's cut out to be. Stiles wasn't even given a guidebook. He isn't a hero. He isn't desperate. He isn't particularly interested in a do-over to save everyone he's ever known. He probably isn't even all that sane. What's a guy out of time to do?</p>
<h3>my name like an elegy</h3>
<p>by <u>caret</u></p>
<p><i>And for one wonderful, terrible moment, Stanley does not recognize it. It looks small in the sand. It wears a pair of cracked glasses, silver hair, and a riot of mushrooms crawling up its neck.</i><br/>
    In which the Narrator dies in the aftermath of the Skip Button Ending, and Stanley doesn't. And then the Narrator lives, piercingly, desperately, and Stanley lives with him.
    Or: A requirem on living, love, and how it twists into hate.<br/>

<h3>every move you make is apocalypse</h3>
<p>by <u>buc-eebarnes</u></p>
<p>You take another sip of tea. The drink is losing some of its heat, but you feel warm regardless. You almost don’t hear the footsteps sneak up behind you, and you don’t know who it is until they situate themselves next to you, leaning on the railing with a datapad in their hands.<br/>
    You glance over, bringing your mug up to your lips, wondering who else found this secluded area, but you stop in your tracks. Speak of the devil. He’s looking up at the stars with a wistful smile.<br/>
    “Mark,” you say softly, surprised.<br/>
    He hums. “Beautiful night, isn’t it, Captain?”<br/>
    In the aftermath of the "Hold On" ending, you try to find your footing on a new planet with your colonists and crew alive. There's one thing you're sure of, though: your head engineer is avoiding you.

<h3>Ukáž mi svoje krídla</h3>
<p>by <u>eryiiyn</u></p>
<p>Rasa zvaná Azroni preberúca Zem zhruba pred dvoma storočiami, odlíšiteľná od ľudí len pár hlavnými znakmi, momentálne ovláda celú planétu. Medzi ich charakteristiku patria modré vlasy, nebezpečné telepatické schopnosti a...krídla, ktoré majú neustále zakryté pred vonkajším svetom, kvôli ich extrémnej citlivosti na dotyk nesprávnej osoby. Za život Azrona sa vždy nájde len jediný parter, ktorý je schopný nespôsobiť svojmu spriaznencovi pri ich dotyku neznesiteľnú bolesť. A práve táto rasa zničila pri svojom nálete skoro celú Zem. 
    Napriek tomu, žiaden z nich nemienil spustošený povrch vrátiť do pôvodnej podoby. Vytvoriac 37 zón, v ktorých bolo prvých 12 vyradených pre ľudí, veľkých ako samotné štáty, sa celý život dial len tam, pripravujúc ich na budúce podradné služby určené k zábave Azronov.  
    Stále, však existovalo niekoľko šťastlivcom, ktorí sa narodili mimo arén, na zdevastovaných uliciach povrchu. A práve na tejto planéte, v úplne odlišných oblastiach žijú dve úplne odlišne osoby...<br/>
    
    Rik, 17 ročný človek, žijúci mimo zón, odchytený Azronskou hliadkou, ihneď predaný do služby bohatej mimozemskej rodiny. Nevyjadrujúci svoje emócie, cítiaci nenávisť ku všetkému vrátane seba samotného.
    Azel, syn vysoko postaveného Azrona, ktorého poslaním je z duše opovrhovať ľuďmi. Nešťastnou zhodou okolností však touto vlastnosťou nekomponuje, čím si podstatne sťažuje život. V blízkosti rodiny a iných svojho druhu je nútený byť...krutým, nemilosrdným a arogantným Azronom. V súkromí, pri ľudských sluhoch...nevinný a láskavý s odporom k násiliu.<br/>
     
    Čo sa stane ak sa zhodou okolností  spoja životy dvoch strán jednej čiernej mince...?
